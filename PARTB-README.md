# Part B Tracking Workspace

This workspace is used to track every allowed target tested for INFO5995 Assignment 2 Part B.

Goals:
- Record every tested website, but keep the documentation lightweight unless the target produces a real candidate finding or a high-value deep-testing path.
- Prevent duplicate testing across teammates.
- Preserve scope evidence, test steps, findings, and rejection reasons.
- Keep records ready for AI log, activity log, presentation, and tutor review.
- Keep the main effort focused on actually finding at least one valid Part B vulnerability rather than over-documenting empty rounds.

Recommended workflow:
1. Always update `partb/master-tracker.md` after each testing session.
2. For `No finding` targets, record only a concise summary in `partb/master-tracker.md`.
3. Create a detailed folder under `partb/targets/` only when one of these is true:
   - there is a `Candidate finding`
   - the target is still `In progress` and already has non-trivial evidence worth preserving
   - the target is `Needs validation`
   - the target is `Reported`
4. If a detailed folder is created, copy `partb/templates/target-test-log-template.md` and store any screenshots, request samples, and notes there.
5. Commit and push after meaningful updates.

Documentation rules:
1. The master tracker records every tested target, including which baseline categories `1-5` were tested and the concise result.
2. `No finding` targets should normally stay lightweight in `partb/master-tracker.md` rather than creating a full detailed folder.
3. Create a detailed folder under `partb/targets/` when the target has a `Candidate finding`, remains `In progress` with non-trivial preserved evidence, `Needs validation`, or `Reported`.
4. If a target moves toward submission-readiness, preserve the exact URLs, screenshots, request/response notes, scope proof, and novelty notes needed for later presentation and Q&A.

Enhanced testing order for each program:
1. Program intake and scope lock.
   - Read the HackerOne program page, overview, and scope before testing.
   - Record the exact program URL, scope page URL, official site URL, welcomed vulnerability types, and any rules such as `use only your own account(s)`.
2. Attack surface mapping.
   - Map the product's reachable surfaces before deep testing: homepage, login, signup, password reset, invitation flows, onboarding, reports, app/developer areas, billing, sharing, and API or docs surfaces.
3. Pre-auth UI review.
   - Review public pages and public flows for obvious unauthenticated issues such as exposed objects, suspicious parameters, public share links, reflection points, and unsafe redirects.
4. Pre-auth DevTools deep dive.
   - Use browser DevTools to inspect rendered DOM, XHR/fetch traffic, object IDs, tokens, nonces, `state` values, hidden parameters, embedded state objects, and exposed routes or endpoints.
   - Do not stop at noting that a page or form exists. When a likely security-sensitive flow is present, continue into request-level inspection.
5. Baseline common-vulnerability pack.
   - `1) Access control / IDOR / object exposure`
   - `2) Authentication / session / invite / reset / verification / OAuth flow flaws`
   - `3) Token / nonce / randomness / binding quality`
   - `4) Input handling / XSS / unsafe reflection`
   - `5) Misconfiguration / unsafe exposure / business logic boundary`
6. Decide whether login is worth it.
   - Only ask for manual registration/login after the pre-auth and DevTools rounds suggest that authenticated testing is likely to be valuable.
7. Post-auth state confirmation.
   - After login, confirm account state, visible roles, trial/subscription state, newly unlocked navigation, and any project/workspace/report/app surfaces.
8. Post-auth core checks.
   - Re-run the baseline common-vulnerability pack against authenticated features, focusing on object references, session behavior, token flows, plan gates, and deeper input surfaces.
   - If a security-sensitive form exists, try non-destructive abnormal input patterns where allowed by scope and safety rules.
   - Examples:
     - OAuth redirect URI validation
     - token scope / access combinations
     - repeated OIDC `state` / `nonce` / `code_challenge` flow comparison
     - share / invite / workspace object boundary behavior
9. Decide whether a second account or second role is worth it.
   - Escalate to multi-account or multi-role testing only when the target shows meaningful collaboration, invitation, sharing, or ownership boundaries.
10. Evidence and submission-readiness check.
   - Before calling something a candidate finding, confirm reproducibility, scope proof, impact explanation, screenshots/requests, and enough evidence to defend it in the presentation and Q&A.
11. Stop and decide.
   - After each meaningful round, stop and decide whether to continue the same program, request login, request a second account, or move on to the next program.

Minimum information to record for each tested target:
- Platform and program name
- HackerOne program URL
- Program bounty URL
- Official website URL
- Proof that the program overview/rules were read before testing
- Which baseline categories `1-5` were tested
- What customized testing ideas were attempted
- Scope proof
- Exact target URL or asset tested
- Date and team member(s)
- Test types attempted
- What was tested
- Result, including failures and dead ends
- Evidence and screenshots
- Initial impact assessment
- Novelty notes
- Next actions

Assignment rules and grading reference:
- Part B targets must come only from legitimate bug bounty programs or the explicitly allowed company-run programs named in the assignment spec.
- Approved bug bounty platforms in the spec:
  - `HackerOne`
  - `Immunefi`
  - `Bugcrowd`
  - `Intigriti`
  - `YesWeHack`
- Explicitly allowed company-run programs in the spec:
  - `Google VRP`
  - `Meta Bug Bounty`
  - `Microsoft Bug Bounty`
  - `Apple Security Bounty`
  - `GitHub Bug Bounty`
  - `OpenClaw Bug Bounty`
  - `Anthropic Model Safety Bug Bounty`
  - `OpenAI Bug Bounty Program`
- Any other company-run target requires prior written unit coordinator approval before testing.
- Part B is judged primarily on the team's single highest-impact valid in-the-wild finding.
- If no valid in-the-wild finding is submitted, the assignment maximum is capped at `15/25`.
- Only one Part B finding is ultimately submitted and defended.
- Required evidence for a strong Part B result includes:
  - target URL
  - scope proof
  - legal-boundary note
  - reproducible steps
  - screenshots or request evidence
  - clear finding-type classification:
    - `Type 1`: confirmed non-zero-day
    - `Type 2`: zero-day candidate
- If a claimed zero-day does not have novelty evidence, it should be treated as `Type 1`.
- Severity should follow the platform model where available, with CVSS fallback if needed.
- Before final submission, the team should run at least one rubric-driven mock Q&A and record the improvement notes in the AI log.

Why this workflow is stronger:
- It aligns testing with the assignment's real scoring needs: scope handling, evidence quality, impact clarity, and novelty readiness.
- It treats DevTools review as a required step rather than an optional helper.
- It requires deeper validation of risky flows instead of stopping at UI observation.
- It explicitly covers common bounty-heavy areas such as access control, auth/session flaws, token quality, XSS/input handling, and business-logic boundaries.
- It separates single-account testing from multi-account testing so time is not wasted on the wrong setup.

Practical reminder for this assignment:
- The goal is to find at least one valid Part B vulnerability.
- Documentation quality matters, but empty-round documentation should stay lightweight.
- If a flow looks security-relevant, the default is to try to validate it, not just describe it.
- Stay within scope, use only owned accounts/objects, avoid destructive behavior, and prefer non-disruptive abnormal-input testing.
- Do not test on other users' data, use brute force, run disruptive checks, or perform social engineering.
